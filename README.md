  inspired _and_ heavily layed the foundation for this library. Maverick would of not been easily
  possible without such amazing prior art.
- [Vue Lit][vue-lit]: Thanks [Evan You][twitter-vue-author] for building a lightweight reactive
  custom element POC and demonstrating how simple things can be!
