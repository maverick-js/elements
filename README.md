## Inspiration

`@maverick-js/elements` was inspired by:

- [Solid JS][solidjs]: Thanks [Ryan Carniato][twitter-solid-author] for building Solid JS as it
  inspired _and_ heavily layed the foundation for this library. Maverick Elements would of not
  been easily possible without such amazing prior art.
- [Vue Lit][vue-lit]: Thanks [Evan You][twitter-vue-author] for building a lightweight reative
  custom element POC and demonstrating how simple things can be!
